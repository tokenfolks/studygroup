## What is the token Utility?  
LINK tokens are used to pay node operators for retrieving data for smart contracts and also for deposits placed by node operators as required by contract creators.
-   Enables the **exchange** of oracle data services.
-   Network **security** via staking

## What drives demand?  
-   Node **operators need to stake** LINK as a way to offer a bid to the intended buyer of the data.
-   The demand for these LINK tokens are largely dependent on the number of operators that work to secure the network, but the token also derives its value from the other various use cases of the decentralized oracle network. The more use cases the Chainlink platform can be put to, the more valuable the LINK token will be.

## What is the value creation?  
- Allow smart contracts to automate the transfer of **data between blockchains and outside systems** in a highly secure and reliable manner.
- Creation of decentralized networks of operators providing authenticated data.
- Newer features of chainlink: Automation, Randomness, ..

## How does the token capture value?  

- Chainlink operates a fixed-supply model for the LINK token. At launch in 2017, 1 billion LINK were issued with the following allocation: 35% of tokens sold, 30% allocated to the parent company, and remaining 35% held in reserve to pay incentive rewards.
- LINK token is used in the Chainlink network to compensate Chainlink Node operators for the retrieval of data from the external data sources, turning it to blockchain readable format, off-chain computation, and uptime guarantees.
- For instance, if a company wants to use a smart contract enhanced with a Chainlink node, they can do so with LINK tokens only. The Chainlink Node Operator determines the final price according to the demand for the off-chain resource and the supply of similar information.

## What is the business model?
(_this was not clear, if you have a better understanding on how the company behind Chainlink protocol makes money)_

-   Nodes Sell Data to Smart Contracts: from what I understood, the company reserved 30% of LINK tokens. They are kept to compensate the project developers and staff.
