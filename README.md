# About this repo
It's meant to be a knowledge base.

It can be viewed as plain markdown files on your computer or on github.

That said, there's a better way to navigate and create new information. Use https://obsidian.md/ like so:
1. clone this repo locally
2. install obsidian
3. open obsidian and select "Open Folder as Vault", pointing it here.
4. all done, now we have a networked knowledge base

### Contributing
We'll use git to update this repo collaboratively. You can edit articles in Github directly via it's web editor, or clone it locally. In any case, the steps are:
1. commit your changes using your preferred editor & git toolset (web, cli, plugins, etc..)
2. issue a Pull Request to this repo

Note: there are other ways to collab on this (eg. Obsidian Sync). We prefer git because it tracks the full history, not just the latest update; pricing, etc..
